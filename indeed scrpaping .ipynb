Finally, they will place offshore resources at lower billable rates and remove you from the project citing budgetary constraints. Senior principals are the biggest risk job. They will put you on the project for a couple months for the design and then chuck you out and bring lower rated consultants (offshore and lower level principals/senior consultants) who can now make headway on their own since the most complex part of design has been done by Sr. Principal's. Basically, they use and abuse people for their experience and the let them go if there is no more work available. If something comes up, they will hire immediately. Hiring immediately means they may hire incompetent persons in the rush which has been the case. I have personally been put on difficult projects where several former Sr. Principal's were removed from the project by the client. This was caused by this philosophy of use and fire and then rehire when and as needed. If they had better sense, they would strive to keep their good guys instead of citing reasons of non performance due to low utilisation or sales revenue. If I am going to go around make sales for you and then do the actual design work, why would I be a lacky for someone else? I would just go and do private contracting and/or build sales for myself or for a company where I have partner sharing margins. - more...\n",
